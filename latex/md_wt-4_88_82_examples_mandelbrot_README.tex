This example shows renders the famous mandelbrot fractal in small tiles which are served as individual images. These tiles are calculated on-\/demand, as the user navigates through the set.

This is similar to how one navigates through google maps, but in this case, the images are computed on the fly, instead of being retrieved from a database.\hypertarget{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_mandelbrot_README_autotoc_md105}{}\doxysection{How to run}\label{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_mandelbrot_README_autotoc_md105}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the use of a custom {\ttfamily W\+Resource} that computes contents on the fly
\item the use of {\ttfamily W\+Raster\+Image} for painting raster graphics
\item the use of {\ttfamily W\+Virtual\+Image} for a virtual image that consists of smaller tiled images
