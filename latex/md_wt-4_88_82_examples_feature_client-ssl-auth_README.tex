This is an example that illustrates the use of the {\ttfamily W\+Ssl\+Info} and \textquotesingle{}W\+Ssl\+Certificate\textquotesingle{} to authenticate clients based on S\+SL certificates. The example also demonstrates how this S\+SL based authentication can be combined with \mbox{\hyperlink{classWt}{Wt}}\textquotesingle{}s authentication framework.\hypertarget{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_feature_client-ssl-auth_README_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysection{How to run}\label{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_feature_client-ssl-auth_README_autotoc_md52}

S\+SL certificates should be obtained (purchased) from Certificate Authorities, but for testing you can use Open\+S\+SL to generate your own test certificates. This example requires CA public keys, server public and private keys, and client public and private keys.

You will need to configure your webserver to work with these keys. A sample configuration for the built-\/in \mbox{\hyperlink{classWt}{Wt}} httpd is\+:

docroot=. http-\/address=0.\+0.\+0.\+0 http-\/port=8080 https-\/address=0.\+0.\+0.\+0 https-\/port=4430 ssl-\/certificate=projects/ssl/my\+C\+A/certs/server.\+crt ssl-\/private-\/key=projects/ssl/my\+C\+A/private/server.\+key ssl-\/tmp-\/dh=projects/ssl/dh2048.\+pem ssl-\/client-\/verification=required ssl-\/verify-\/depth=15 ssl-\/ca-\/certificates=projects/ssl/my\+C\+A/certs/myca.\+crt\hypertarget{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_feature_client-ssl-auth_README_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysection{What it illustrates}\label{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_feature_client-ssl-auth_README_autotoc_md53}
