The simplechat example is a simple multi-\/user client + server. It is simple in many ways, including the constraint that all sessions run in the same process (it does not use inter-\/process communication), and that the client does not have any advanced functions.

The example can be run as a plain \mbox{\hyperlink{classWt}{Wt}} application, but also as a widget set widget, which is a popup chat box that sits in the bottom right of the browser window, and can be integrated easily in another website.
