The example shows a typical full-\/window application with a tree (a {\ttfamily W\+Tree\+View}) that represents different \textquotesingle{}folders\textquotesingle{}, and a table (a {\ttfamily W\+Table\+View}) which represents \textquotesingle{}documents\textquotesingle{} that belong to this office. The size of these documents is shown in a pie chart (a {\ttfamily W\+Pie\+Chart}).

Two data models ({\ttfamily W\+Standard\+Item\+Model}) back these views\+: one for the folders, and one for the files.

Drag \& Drop is configured so that files can be selected and dragged into a different folder. Changes to the model are automatically reflected in the relevant views.\hypertarget{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_treeview-dragdrop_README_autotoc_md127}{}\doxysection{How to run}\label{md_wt-4_88_82_examples_treeview-dragdrop_README_autotoc_md127}
